Hello, Welcome to my Github!

On this page you can see different interesting Data Science Projects I worked on. For every project there is a pdf file which contains a summary with explanations, and jupyter notebooks with the code. 


* Classification-of-epileptic-EEG-recordings-using-signal-transforms-and-convolutional-neural-networks - This project reimplements and extends the deep learning pipeline from "Classification of epileptic EEG recordings using signal transforms and convolutional neural networks" by San-Segundo et al., originally designed for EEG seizure detection. The core idea is to test the transferability of biomedical signal processing techniques to a completely different domain: music genre classification.



* PoincareEmbeddings - This project explores the performance and robustness of Poincaré embeddings, a type of hyperbolic embedding used to capture hierarchical structures in data.



* SDXS-Model-Deep-Learning  - This is a project my good friend Ibrahim Bashir ( ibrahimxbashir on github) and I worked on during our Master's Degree for the "Advanced Computational Learning and Data Analysis" course. This project explores how to improve the artistic diversity and image accuracy of the Stable Diffusion XS (SDXS) model—a lightweight, efficient latent diffusion model architecture designed for fast and resource-efficient image generation. While SDXS is optimized for speed, it often sacrifices output diversity and fidelity to the input prompt.


* Applied-Project-code - This project investigates supervised machine learning models for predicting emotional responses from audio data, focusing on Lasso Regression and XGBoost. We analyze a dataset of 1920 features and 6423 samples, targeting five emotions: Arousal, Valence, Interest, Despair, and Joy. The work is split into two phases: model evaluation and data augmentation experiments.

*  DeepLearning-Simple-Implementation - This is my attempt to algebraically derive the forward and backward propagation schemes in neural networks, I also code it with python
